# Predictive Model Using LSTM with Keras

## Overview
This project utilizes **Keras** and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for building a predictive model. The model aims to predict time-series data (such as household power consumption) based on historical patterns. The architecture includes the use of **Sequential**, **Dense**, **Flatten**, and **LSTM** layers to process and predict values efficiently.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and several libraries. To install the required dependencies, you can use the `requirements.txt` file.
## Dependencies
- [Keras: Deep learning library used for building the neural network.](#keras)
- [TensorFlow: Required for Keras to function.](#tensorflow)
- [pandas: Used for data manipulation and loading datasets.](#pandas)
- [NumPy: Used for numerical operations on the data.](#Numpy)
- [matplotlib: Optional, for visualizing results.](#matplotlib)

## Model Architecture
# The architecture of the model includes the following layers:
- [LSTM Layer: A core part of the model, responsible for learning the sequential patterns in the data. The units=50 parameter sets the number of neurons in the LSTM layer.](#LSTM)
- [Flatten Layer: Converts the multi-dimensional output from the LSTM layer into a 1D array.](#Flatten Layer)
- [Dense Layer: A fully connected layer used to generate the output prediction.](#denselayer)
- [Loss Function: mean_squared_error is used as the loss function for regression tasks.](#LossFunction)
